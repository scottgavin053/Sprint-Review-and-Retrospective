## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
  User stories are made to specify what a person using the program wants out of it. For example, on the SNHU Travel project, our user stories defined what someone using the site would like to be able to do. Following these different needs and sometimes wants makes the end product much more valuable to everyone involved.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  By incorporating sprints and prototyping even into personal projects, I will be able to learn how to better plan a project while keeping the velocity high considering the sprint timeline. Many of my personal projects drag on or never get finished due to poor time management. By estimating from the start, I can set reasonable goals to follow instead of just winging it then getting burnt out.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 
  After completing the SNHU Travel project, proper communication is what stands out as being the most vital property to have. When there is any change in plans, there needs to be plenty of communication about the changes in order to ensure that the new goal is met. Just staying on track to complete tasks on time requires teammates to share their problems and progress with one another.
